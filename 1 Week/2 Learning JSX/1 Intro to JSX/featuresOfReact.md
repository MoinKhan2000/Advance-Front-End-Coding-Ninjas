# Features Of React. 
1. `Declarative` ->React follows a declarative paradigm, which means developers describe what the UI should look like rather than worrying about how to implement it step by step. React automatically manages updates and renders the right components when data changes, making the code more predictable and easier to debug.

2. `Component Based` -> React is built around the concept of components. Components are reusable, independent pieces of UI that can be combined to build complex user interfaces. Each component manages its own state and can be composed together to form entire applications. This component-based structure encourages reusability and modularity in your codebase.
 
3. `Efficient for creating SPAs` -> React is highly efficient for building Single Page Applications (SPAs) where the application dynamically updates the content without reloading the page. React handles UI updates efficiently with its virtual DOM, which minimizes the direct manipulation of the real DOM. This leads to faster performance and a smoother user experience when building interactive and dynamic applications.



# Why JSX
* React embraces the fact that `rendering logic should be coupled with UI logic.`
* Helpful as a `visual ad` when working with UI Inside javaScript.
* React `seperates concerns` instead of seperating technologies.
* It also allows React to show more `useful errors` and `warning messages`.
